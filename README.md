# MassCasualty

MassCasualty is a discrete-event simulation for mass casualty triage scenarios aboard Mercy-class ships. 

## Getting Started

This project requires Python with the following libraries.
* Numpy
* Simpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

Setup your environment to be able to run Python files, as well has have the necessary permissions to allow the import functions in main.py to download the above dependencies.

## Usage

Detailed commenting is provided within the main.py program file.

     The intended audience is a Marine, unfamiliar with programming or simulation.

## Output

Sampling of a few output methods using a small sample size for the sake of example. As such, it is noted that the Time to Location and Time To Care values are zero, as too few Marines were introduced to ilicit strain.
Please refer to the Wiki for list of all outputs.
